# 🚀 AWS Threat Composer Deployment via ECS & Terraform

## Project Overview
This project deploys the Amazon **Threat Composer Tool**, an open-source application for threat modeling and security assessment, onto **AWS ECS (Fargate)** using **Terraform**. The deployment is designed to be fully automated, leveraging modular Terraform code to provision all necessary infrastructure components. Infrastructure changes and application deployments are managed through **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines**, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and minimal manual intervention.

The solution provisions a secure and scalable cloud environment, including **VPC networking**, an **Application Load Balancer** with **HTTPS via ACM**, **Route 53** DNS records, and a container image hosted in **Amazon ECR**. With a single workflow, the application can be built, scanned for vulnerabilities, deployed, and made accessible via a custom domain over HTTPS — delivering a ready-to-use threat modeling platform in minutes.

## ✨ Key Features
#### 📊 Threat Composer Application
- **Amazon Threat Composer**: Deploys the open-source threat modeling tool in a containerised environment
- **Browser-Based Access**: Accessible via HTTPS with a custom Route 53 domain
- **Dockerised Deployment**: Application container built, pushed, and run on ECS Fargate
- **Ready-to-Use Setup**: No manual installation — app is live after pipeline execution

#### 🚀 Infrastructure Automation
- **Terraform Modules**: Modular design for VPC, ECS, ALB, Route 53, and ACM
- **GitHub Actions Pipelines**: Automated workflows for Docker build/push, Terraform plan/apply/destroy
- **ECR Integration**: Docker images built and pushed directly into Amazon ECR
- **Scalable ECS Fargate**: Serverless compute with task definition and service management
- **Automated DNS & SSL**: Route 53 records and ACM certificates provisioned automatically

#### 🔐 Security & Compliance
- **ACM-Managed TLS**: Encrypted HTTPS connections via Application Load Balancer
- **Network Isolation**: Security groups restrict access to only necessary traffic (ALB ↔ ECS)
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Fine grained AWS permissions for ECS tasks and pipelines
- **Code & Container Security**:
  - **Pre-Commit Hooks & Linting →** Terraform code is automatically formatted and validated before any commit, catching syntax errors and misconfigurations early
  - **Checkov →** Scans Terraform infrastructure for policy violations and security misconfigurations, ensuring compliance before deployment
  - **Trivy →** Scans container images for critical and high-severity vulnerabilities before they are pushed to ECR, preventing insecure images from reaching production

#### 📈 Monitoring & Reliability

- **ALB Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of ECS task health via load balancer
- **ECS Service Insights**: Built in metrics for CPU, memory, and scaling behavior
- **Centralised Logging**: ECS, ALB, and VPC logs available in CloudWatch
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with load-balanced traffic distribution

## ⚙️ How It Works
### 1️⃣ Build & Push Docker Image
The application container is built from the `app/` directory and managed via a GitHub Actions workflow (`docker-build-push.yaml`). When triggered manually, it:
- Authenticates to Amazon ECR using **GitHub secrets**.
- **Builds & tags** the Docker image (`ecs-threat-app:latest`).
- **Scans vulnerabilities** with Trivy (CRITICAL/HIGH severities).
- Publishes results to GitHub’s **Security** tab.
- **Pushes** the image to Amazon ECR for ECS deployment.
```yaml
- name: Build the image
  run: |
    docker build -t ecs-threat-app ./app
    docker tag ecs-threat-app:latest ${{ secrets.AWS_REPOSITORY }}/ecs-threat-app:latest

- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0
```
### 2️⃣ Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
All infrastructure is defined under the `terraform/` directory, with each core AWS service organised into its own **module** (`vpc/`, `alb/`, `ecs/`, `acm/`, `route53/`). This modular approach makes the code easy to extend, test, and maintain.

- **VPC Module →** Creates a dedicated VPC with subnets, route tables, and an internet gateway to securely host the application
- **ALB Module →** Provisions an Application Load Balancer with HTTPS termination using ACM. Traffic is routed only to healthy ECS tasks
- **ECS Module →** Deploys the containerised Threat Composer application to Fargate, pulling the latest image from ECR and scaling on demand
- **Route 53 Module →** Configures DNS to make the app available at a custom domain, routed securely through the ALB

```yaml
module "ecs" {
  source                      = "./modules/ecs"
  ecs_container_name          = var.ecs_container_name
  vpc_id                      = module.vpc.vpc_id
  ecs_service_desired_count   = var.ecs_service_desired_count
  ecs_ingress_sg_ids          = [module.alb.lb_sg_id]
  ...
}
```

With a single `terraform apply`, the complete infrastructure — networking, security, compute, and DNS — is provisioned automatically, delivering a **secure and production-ready ECS environment**.

### 3️⃣ Terraform Plan & Security Scanning
Before any infrastructure changes are applied, the **Terraform Plan workflow** provides a controlled and secure validation step. This ensures infrastructure changes are safe, compliant, and free from misconfigurations before deployment.

- **Terraform Plan →** Runs `terraform init` and `terraform plan` to preview changes without applying them.
- **Linting (TFLint) →** Catches syntax errors, unused variables, and configuration issues early.
- **Policy Scanning (Checkov)** → Enforces security best practices (e.g., encrypted storage, least-privilege IAM roles, network restrictions).
- **SARIF Reports →** Both TFLint and Checkov results are uploaded to GitHub’s Security tab for visibility and auditing.

```yaml
- name: Run TFLint
  run: |
    tflint --init
    tflint --format sarif > tflint.sarif

- name: Run Checkov
  uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@v12
```

> 📌 **Key benefit:** Every infrastructure change is previewed, linted, and scanned for compliance before it ever reaches AWS, reducing security risks and catching issues early in the pipeline.

### 4️⃣ Terraform Apply & Destroy Pipelines
After validating infrastructure changes in the Plan stage, the **Terraform Apply workflow** provisions or updates the full AWS stack — including VPC, ALB, ECS Fargate, ACM certificates, and Route 53 DNS. This workflow ensures that changes are applied consistently and safely across all environments.

```yaml
- name: Apply Terraform
  run: terraform apply --auto-approve
```

The **Terraform Destroy** workflow allows you to safely tear down environments when they’re no longer needed, which is especially useful for development or testing to avoid unnecessary AWS costs:

```yaml
- name: Destroy Terraform
  run: terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

### 🔹 Pre-Commit Hooks
To maintain code quality and consistency, this project uses **pre-commit hooks** defined in `pre-commit-config.yaml`. These hooks automatically run checks before any commit is accepted, preventing formatting errors, enforcing standards, and catching syntax errors or misconfigurations early, keeping the repository clean and reliable.

**Key Hooks:**
- **Terraform** (`pre-commit-terraform`)
  - **terraform_fmt** → Formats Terraform code
  - **terraform_validate** → Checks Terraform files for syntax and configuration errors
  - **terraform_tflint** → Detects potential misconfigurations or best-practice violations
- **General Code Quality** (`pre-commit-hooks`)
  - Removes trailing whitespace
  - Fixes end-of-file newlines
  - Normalises line endings to LF.
- **YAML Linting** (`yamllint`)
  - Ensures GitHub Actions workflows and other YAML files follow proper formatting and indentation.
